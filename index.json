C’est une marche aléatoire qui un a une mémoire de tout son passé mais aussi un exemple simple de processus de Markov inhomogène en temps. Son comportement dépend d’un paramètre de mémoire et est catégorisé en trois régimes : diffusif, critique et super-diffusif. Dans cet exposé, on commencera par présenter le modèle puis le lien entre la marche, les urnes de Pòlya à remplacement aléatoire et les arbres aléatoires récursifs avec percolation de Bernoulli. On expliquera comme l’approche par les urnes permet d’obtenir une équation de point fixe sur la variable aléatoire limite qui apparait dans le régime super-diffusif et d’en déduire des informations sur cette variable.\nTravail en collaboration avec Hélène Guérin et Kilian Raschel.\nAnne Laure Basdevant Coloriage poissonien du plan\nDans cet exposé, nous considérerons un modèle où des points tombent successivement au hasard sur une région du plan et prennent alors la couleur du point déjà présent le plus proche de lui. Nous donnerons quelques propriétés topologiques du coloriage limite et nous regarderons en particulier la dimension de Hausdorff de la frontière des clusters de chaque couleur.\nTravail avec G. Blanc, N. Curien et A. Singh.\nNiccolo Torri Limite hydrodynamique du modèle de Schelling\nLe sujet principal de cet exposé est le modèle de Schelling, un modèle d’agents qui décrit une dynamique de ségrégation quand nous avons la cohabitation de deux groupes sociaux. Le comportement de ce modèle a été étudié en utilisant plusieurs approches, notamment en utilisant des outils de la physique théorique et de la simulation numérique. Ces approches amènent à conjecturer un diagramme de phase où soit les différents groupes sociaux sont ségrégués dans des clusters macroscopiques, soit ils sont mélangés. D’un point de vue mathématique, à notre connaissance, ce modèle a été étudié pour la première fois par Holden et Sheffield (2020). Dans cet exposé nous allons présenter les résultats que nous avons obtenu concernant l’existence d’une limite hydrodynamique en considérant le modèle de Schelling perturbé par une dynamique de Glauber et une de Kawasaki.\nTravail en collaboration avec Florent Barret, Université Paris-Nanterre.\nEleanor Archer La percolation critique sur les arbres de Galton-Watson\nDans cet exposé, nous prendrons un arbre de Galton-Watson sur-critique d’espérance $m \u0026gt; 1$, et nous echantillons une percolation sur l’arbre. Il est bien connu que la probabilité critique pour ce modèle est $1/m$ et que l’amas de la racine à la loi d’un arbre de Galton-Watson critique. Pour cette raison de nombreuses propriétés de l’amas sont bien comprises, par exemple la probabilité à survivre jusqu’à la $k$-ieme génération, la loi de la taille de la $k$-ieme génération conditionnée à être strictement positive (la “limite de Yaglom”), et la convergence vers un processus du branchement. Tous ces résultats sont annealed, c’est-à-dire que nous prenons l’espérance par rapport à la loi de l’arbre et de la percolation simultanément. L’objectif de cet exposé est de considérer le régime quenched : ses propriétés sont-elles vraies pour presque toute réalisation de l’arbre ? Nous allons voir que c’est bien le cas.\nBasé sur un travail en cours avec Quirin Vogel.\n","date":1696896000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1696896000,"objectID":"17ae7da153d8b710728519744c82ad77","permalink":"https://JosueCorujo.github.io/events/2023discretecreteil/","publishdate":"2023-10-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/events/2023discretecreteil/","section":"events","summary":"12th December 2023","tags":null,"title":"Discrete randomness in Créteil","type":"events"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" PDF Chachachá, my cat Table of Contents 1.

In SM mathematics, models may be incompletely or inconsistently specified; the focus is on obtaining conclusions about the model, allowing appeals to physical realism, unquantified approximations, and arguments by analogy.

The exact calculation of the expected SFS in panmictic population has been derived in the Markovian coalescent theory for decades, but its generalization to the structured coalescent is hampered by the almost exponential growth of the states space. We propose here a complete algorithmic procedure, from how to build a suitable state space and sort it, to how to take advantage of the sparsity of the rate matrix and to solve numerically the linear system by an iterative method. The simplest case of the symmetrical n-island is then processed to arrive at a ready-to-use demographic parameters inference framework.","tags":["Site Frequency Spectrum","structured population"],"title":"Exact calculation of the expected SFS in structured populations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Josué Corujo Rodríguez","Vlada Limic"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1683590400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1683590400,"objectID":"138223678c4974e54fef9a93bda8ce53","permalink":"https://JosueCorujo.github.io/publication/09_playful_note/","publishdate":"2023-05-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/09_playful_note/","section":"publication","summary":"Consider a finite inhomogeneous random graph running in continuous time, where each vertex has a mass, and the edge that links any pair of vertices appears with a rate equal to the product of their masses.

Moreover, with the additional information on the number of surplus edges, the resulting process follows the augmented multiplicative coalescent dynamic, constructed by Bhamidi, Budhiraja and Wang in 2014. The same authors exhibit the scaling limit, which can be specified in terms of the infinite vector of excursions (in particular their lengths, and the areas enclosed by the excursion curves) above past infima of a reflected Brownian motion with linear infinitesimal drift. We use some recent results, using a graph exploration process called the simultaneous breadth-first walk, to study the same scaling limit, called the standard augmented multiplicative coalescent (SAMC).

The Moran model we consider is a non-reversible in general, continuous-time Markov chain with unknown stationary distribution. Specifically, we consider $N$ individuals such that each one of them is of one type among $K$ possible allelic types. The individuals interact in two ways, by an independent irreducible mutation process and by a reproduction process, where a pair of individuals is randomly chosen, one of them dies and the other reproduces. Our main result provides explicit expressions for the eigenvalues of the infinitesimal generator matrix of the Moran process, in terms of the eigenvalues of the jump rate matrix. As consequences of this result, we study the convergence in total variation of the process to stationarity. Our results include a lower bound for the mixing time of the Moran process when the mutation process allows a real eigenvalue. Furthermore, we study in detail the spectral decomposition of the neutral multi-allelic Moran model with parent independent mutation scheme, which turns to be the unique mutation scheme that makes the neutral Moran process reversible. Under the parent independent mutation, we also prove the existence of a cutoff phenomenon in the chi-square and the total variation distances when initially all the individuals are of the same type and the number of individuals tends to infinity. Additionally, in the absence of reproduction, we prove that the the total variation distance to stationarity of the parent independent mutation process, when initially all the individuals are of the same type, has a Gaussian profile.","tags":["Moran type particle system","QSD","Cut-off phenomenon"],"title":"On the spectrum and ergodicity of a neutral multi-allelic Moran model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Josué Corujo Rodríguez","David Flores-Peñaloza","Clemens Huemer","Pablo Pérez-Lantero","Carlos Seara"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1678752000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1678752000,"objectID":"cfbaa87ede77a57e36199d6af3897551","permalink":"https://JosueCorujo.github.io/publication/07_joco/","publishdate":"2023-03-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/07_joco/","section":"publication","summary":"Given $n\u003e0$, let $S\\subset [0,1]^2$ be a set of $n$ points, chosen uniformly at random.

The rate matrix driving the mutation is assumed irreducible and the selection rates are assumed uniformly bounded. The paper is divided into two parts. The first one deals with processes with general selection rates. For this case we are able to prove the propagation of chaos in $L^p$ over the compacts, with speed of convergence of order $1/\\sqrt{N}$. Further on, we consider a specific type of selection that we call additive selection. Essentially, we assume that the selection rate can be decomposed as the sum of three terms, a term depending on the allelic type of the parent (which can be understood as selection at death), another term depending on the allelic type of the descendant (which can be understood as selection at birth) and a third term which is symmetric. Under this setting, our results include a uniform in time bound for the propagation on chaos in Lp of order $1/\\sqrt{N}$, and the proof of the asymptotic normality with zero mean and explicit variance, for the approximation error between the empirical distribution and its limit, when the number of individuals tend towards infinity. Additionally, we explore the interpretation of the Moran model with additive selection as a particle process whose empirical distribution approximates a quasi-stationary distribution, in the same spirit as the Fleming-Viot particle systems.

We also obtain a bound uniform in time for the convergence of the proportion of particles in each state when the number of particles goes to infinity.","tags":["Moran type particle system","Fleming-Viot particle system","QSD"],"title":"Dynamics of a Fleming–Viot type particle system on the cycle graph","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Josué Corujo Rodríguez"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1612483200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612483200,"objectID":"7b4e90cd2c2301ca9bca0556f6f0a17b","permalink":"https://JosueCorujo.github.io/publication/03_2019_peis/","publishdate":"2021-02-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/03_2019_peis/","section":"publication","summary":"Reliability properties associated with the classic models of systems with age replacement have been a usual topic of research. Most previous works have checked the aging properties of the lifetime of the working units using stochastic comparisons among the systems with age replacement at different times. However, from a practical point of view, it would also be interesting to deduce to which aging classes the lifetime of the system belongs, making use of the aging properties of the lifetime of its working units. The first part of this article deals with this problem. Further along, stochastic orderings are established between the systems with replacement at the same time using several stochastic comparisons among the lifetimes of their working units. In addition, the lifetimes of two systems with age replacement are compared as well. This is performed assuming stochastic orderings between the number of replacement until failure, and the lifetimes of their working units conditioned to be less or equal than the replacement time. Similar comparisons are accomplished considering two systems with age replacement where the replacements occur at a random time. Illustrative examples are presented throughout the paper.","tags":["Age replacement","Stochastic orders"],"title":"Further results on stochastic orderings and aging classes in systems with age replacement","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Josué Corujo Rodríguez","David Flores-Peñaloza","Clemens Huemer","Pablo Pérez-Lantero","Carlos Seara"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1582156800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1582156800,"objectID":"1b20a997e8095886c71090d2b17c4b30","permalink":"https://JosueCorujo.github.io/publication/0a_matchin_points/","publishdate":"2020-02-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/0a_matchin_points/","section":"publication","summary":"Let $S \\subset [0,1]^2$ be a set of $n$ points, randomly and uniformly selected. Let $R \\cup B$ be a random partition, or coloring, of $S$ in which each point of $S$ is included in $R$ uniformly at random with probability $1/2$. We study the random variable $M(n)$ equal to the number of points of $S$ that are covered by the rectangles of a maximum strong matching of $S$ with axis-aligned rectangles. The matching consists of closed rectangles that cover exactly two points of $S$ of the same color. A matching is strong if all its rectangles are pairwise disjoint. We prove that almost surely $M(n) \\geq 0.83 n$ for $n$ large enough. Our approach is based on modeling a deterministic greedy matching algorithm, that runs over the random point set, as a Markov chain.","tags":["Stochastic algorithm","Strong matching"],"title":"Matching Random Colored Points with Rectangles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Josué Corujo"],"categories":[],"content":"Simulations for the (augmented) multiplicative coalescent $$ B_t(s) = W_t(s) - \\inf_{0 \\leq u \\leq s} W_t(u),$$ where $ W_t(s) = W(s) - \\frac{1}{2}s^2 + t s $.\n$X_i(t)$: $i$th largest excursion of $B_t(\\cdot)$ above zero,\n$\\big( \\pmb{X}(t), t \\ge 0 \\big) $ is a realization of an eternal multiplicative coalescent.\n$W_t(s) = W(s) - \\frac{s^2}{2} + t s$, for $t = 0.5$ $B_t(s) = W_t(s) - \\inf\\limits_{0 \\le u \\le s} W_t(u)$, for $t = 0.5$ $\\Lambda$: homogeneous Poisson point process on $\\mathbb{R}_+^2$, $X_i(t)$: $i$th largest excursion above zero, $Y_i(t)$: nb. of marks below the curve during the $i$th largest excursion. $\\big( (\\pmb{X}(t), \\pmb{Y}(t)), t \\ge 0 \\big) $ is a realization of an eternal augmented multiplicative coalescent.\n$B_t(s) = W_t(s) - \\inf\\limits_{0 \\le u \\le s} W_t(u)$, for $t = 0.5$ Thanks for your attention!

At the same time, there has been an increasing recognition that population structure can generate genetic data similar to those produced under models of population size change. Recently, Mazet et al. (Heredity 116:362–371, 2016) showed that, for any model of population structure, it is always possible to find a panmictic model with a particular function of population size changes, having exactly the same distribution of $T_2$ (the coalescence time for a sample of size two) as that of the structured model. They called this function IICR (Inverse Instantaneous Coalescence Rate) and showed that it does not necessarily correspond to population size changes under non-panmictic models. Besides, most of the methods used to analyse data under models of population structure tend to arbitrarily fix that structure and to minimise or neglect population size changes. Here, we extend the seminal work of Herbots (PhD thesis, University of London, 1994) on the structured coalescent and propose a new framework, the Non-Stationary Structured Coalescent (NSSC) that incorporates demographic events (changes in gene flow and/or deme sizes) to models of nearly any complexity. We show how to compute the IICR under a wide family of stationary and non-stationary models. As an example we address the question of human and Neanderthal evolution and discuss how the NSSC framework allows to interpret genomic data under this new perspective.","tags":["Population genetics","Structured populations","IICR"],"title":"The IICR and the non-stationary structured coalescent: towards demographic inference with arbitrary changes in population structure","type":"publication"}]
