Mazet et al. (2016) introduced, for a sample of size $k=2$ haploid genomes, a time- and sample-dependent parameter which they called the IICR (inverse instantaneous coalescence rate). Here we extend their work to larger sample sizes and focus on $T_k$, the time to the first coalescence event in a haploid sample of size $k$ where $k \\geq 2$. We define the $\\text{IICR}_k$ as the Inverse Instantaneous Coalescence Rate among $k$ lineages. We show that (i) under a panmictic population $\\binom{k}{2}\\times \\text{IICR}_k$ is equivalent to $N_e$, (ii) the $ \\text{IICR}_k$ can be obtained by either simulating $T_k$ values or by using the $Q$-matrix approach of Rodríguez et al. (2018) and we provide the corresponding Python and R scripts. We then study the properties of the $\\binom{k}{2}\\times \\text{IICR}_k$ under a limited set of $n$-island and stepping-stone models. Besides, (iii) in structured models the $\\binom{k}{2}\\times \\text{IICR}_k$ is dependent on the sample size and on the sampling scheme, even when the genomes are sampled in the same deme. For instance, we find that $\\binom{k}{2}\\times \\text{IICR}_k$ plots for individuals sampled in the same deme will be shifted towards recent times with a lower plateau as $k$ increases. We thus show that (iv) the $\\binom{k}{2}\\times \\text{IICR}_k$ cannot be used to represent \"the demographic history\" in a general sense, (v) the $\\binom{k}{2}\\times \\text{IICR}_k$  can be estimated from real or simulated genomic data using the PSMC/MSMC methods, (vi) the MSMC2 method produces smoother curves that infer something that is not the $\\binom{k}{2}\\times \\text{IICR}_k$, but are close to the $\\binom{2}{2}\\times \\text{IICR}_2$ in the recent past when all samples are obtained from the same deme. Altogether we argue that the PSMC, MSMC and MSMC2 plots are not expected to be identical even when the genomes are sampled from the same deme, that none can be said to represent the \"demographic history of populations\" and that they should be interpreted with care. We suggest that the PSMC, MSMC and MSMC2 could be used together with the $\\binom{k}{2}\\times \\text{IICR}_k$ to identify the signature of population structure, and to develop new strategies for model choice.","tags":["multiple genomes","coalescence rate","IICR","sampling scheme","demographi history","population structure","population size change","genomic data","model choice","model exclusion"],"title":"Extending the IICR to multiple genomes and identification of limitations of some demographic inferential methods","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Josué Corujo"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1718064000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1718064000,"objectID":"22de94d04239fff300cf61388df10575","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/11_nb_cc_random_graph/","publishdate":"2024-06-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/11_nb_cc_random_graph/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a detailed study of the evolution of the number of connected components in sub-critical multiplicative random graph processes. We consider a model where edges appear independently after an exponential time at rate equal to the product of the sizes of the vertices. We provide an explicit expression for the fluid limit of the number of connected components normalized by its initial value, when the time is smaller than the inverse of the sum of the square of the initial vertex sizes. We also identify the diffusion limit of the rescaled fluctuations around the fluid limit. This is applied to several examples. In the particular setting of the Erdős-Rényi graph process, we explicit the fluid limit of the number of connected components normalized, and the diffusion limit of the scaled fluctuations in the sub-critical regime, where the mean degree is between zero and one.","tags":["random graphs","multiplicative coalescent","number of connected components","Erdös-Rényi random graph process"],"title":"The number of connected components in sub-critical random graph processes","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Poster fait par Irene Ayuso Ventura Organisée par Aurelia Deshayes et moi, et financée par le LAMA et l’Université Paris Est Créteil, on vous invite à nous rejoindre pour cette journée sur quelques modèles discrets de probabilité.\nQuand : mardi 12 décembre 2023 de 9h30 à 17h\nOù : salle P1 033 à la Faculté des Sciences et Technologie de l’Université Paris Est Créteil | Plan d’accès et PDF du planning du campus\nOrateurs :\nEleanor Archer (Modal’X, Université de Nanterre) Anne Laure Basdevant (LPSM, Sorbonne Université ) Lucile Laulin (Modal’X, Université de Nanterre) Nahuel Soprano Loto (LAAS, CNRS et CONICET) Niccolo Torri (Modal’X, Université de Nanterre) Nicolás Zalduendo (IECL, Université de Lorraine et INRIA Grand Est) Programme 09h30-10h15 Lucile Laulin À propos de la limite super-diffusive de la marche aléatoire de l’éléphant 10h15-10h45 Pause 10h45-11h30 Nicolás Zalduendo The multi-type bisexual Galton-Watson branching process 11h30-12h15 Anne Laure Basdevant Coloriage poissonien du plan 12h30-14h00 Repas 14h00-14h45 Niccolo Torri Limite hydrodynamique du modèle de Schelling 14h45-15h30 Eleanor Archer La percolation critique sur les arbres de Galton-Watson 15h30-16h00 Pause 16h00-16h45 Nahuel Soprano Loto Stochastic matching and online matching algorithms Résumés Lucile Laulin À propos de la limite super-diffusive de la marche aléatoire de l’éléphant\nLa marche aléatoire de l’éléphant a été introduite en 2004 par des physiciens. C’est une marche aléatoire qui un a une mémoire de tout son passé mais aussi un exemple simple de processus de Markov inhomogène en temps. Son comportement dépend d’un paramètre de mémoire et est catégorisé en trois régimes : diffusif, critique et super-diffusif. Dans cet exposé, on commencera par présenter le modèle puis le lien entre la marche, les urnes de Pòlya à remplacement aléatoire et les arbres aléatoires récursifs avec percolation de Bernoulli. On expliquera comme l’approche par les urnes permet d’obtenir une équation de point fixe sur la variable aléatoire limite qui apparait dans le régime super-diffusif et d’en déduire des informations sur cette variable.\nTravail en collaboration avec Hélène Guérin et Kilian Raschel.\nNicolás Zalduendo The multi-type bisexual Galton-Watson branching process\nThe bisexual Galton-Watson process is an extension of the classical Galton-Watson process, but taking into account the mating of females and males, which form couples that can accomplish reproduction. Properties such as extinction conditions and asymptotic behaviour have been studied in the past years, but multi-type versions have only been treated in some particular cases. In this work we deal with a general multi-dimensional version of Daley’s model, where we consider different types of females and males, which mate according to a “mating function”. We consider that this function is superadditive, which in simple words implies that two groups of females and males will form a larger number of couples together rather than separate. One of the main difficulties in the study of this process is the absence of a linear operator that is the key to understand its behavior in the asexual case, but in our case it turns out to be only concave. To overcome this issue, we use a concave Perron-Frobenius theory which ensures the existence of eigen-elements for some concave operators. Using this tool, we find a necessary and sufficient condition for almost sure extinction as well as a law of large numbers. Finally, we study the convergence of the process in the long-time through the identification of a supermartingale.\nAnne Laure Basdevant Coloriage poissonien du plan\nDans cet exposé, nous considérerons un modèle où des points tombent successivement au hasard sur une région du plan et prennent alors la couleur du point déjà présent le plus proche de lui. Nous donnerons quelques propriétés topologiques du coloriage limite et nous regarderons en particulier la dimension de Hausdorff de la frontière des clusters de chaque couleur.\nTravail avec G. Blanc, N. Curien et A. Singh.\nNiccolo Torri Limite hydrodynamique du modèle de Schelling\nLe sujet principal de cet exposé est le modèle de Schelling, un modèle d’agents qui décrit une dynamique de ségrégation quand nous avons la cohabitation de deux groupes sociaux. Le comportement de ce modèle a été étudié en utilisant plusieurs approches, notamment en utilisant des outils de la physique théorique et de la simulation numérique. Ces approches amènent à conjecturer un diagramme de phase où soit les différents groupes sociaux sont ségrégués dans des clusters macroscopiques, soit ils sont mélangés. D’un point de vue mathématique, à notre connaissance, ce modèle a été étudié pour la première fois par Holden et Sheffield (2020). Dans cet exposé nous allons présenter les résultats que nous avons obtenu concernant l’existence d’une limite hydrodynamique en considérant le modèle de Schelling perturbé par une dynamique de Glauber et une de Kawasaki.\nTravail en …","date":1696896000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1696896000,"objectID":"d896a57423ddeb2cd4ca49bad65399da","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/organized_events/2023discretecreteil/","publishdate":"2023-10-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/organized_events/2023discretecreteil/","section":"organized_events","summary":"12th December 2023","tags":null,"title":"Discrete randomness in Créteil","type":"organized_events"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Vendredi 14 juin 2024 à 15h salle D101-102 Sorbonne Université 1516-3-09 LJLL, couloir 15-16, salle 309 (voici le plan d’accès) Existence and stability in the voltage-conductance equation - Claudia Fonte Sánchez (Inria Grenoble) Vendredi 3 mai 2024 à 15h salle D101-102 (bâtiment Maurice Allais - 1er étage), à l’Université Paris Nanterre Predicting treatment success in cancer immunotherapy: A causal inference approach - Lizet Sanchez Valdés (Centro de Inmunología Molecular, Cuba) Field experiments evaluating irradiated Aedes aegypti males for the Sterile Insect Technique - René Gato Armas (Intituto de Medicina Tropical Pedro Pedro Kourí, Cuba) Vendredi 8 Décembre 2023 à 14h30, bât Borel de IHP en salle Olga Ladyjenskaïa (ex salle 01) Modelling Turing-Hopf patterns - Mariano Rodríguez Ricard (U.

In SM mathematics, models may be incompletely or inconsistently specified; the focus is on obtaining conclusions about the model, allowing appeals to physical realism, unquantified approximations, and arguments by analogy. In TP mathematics, one is supposed to have explicit assumptions and conclusions, as well as a rigorous argument linking them. - David Aldous (Bernoulli 5(1), 1999, 3-48) Erdös-Rényi random graph The limit process $$ B_t(s) = W_t(s) - \\inf_{0 \\leq u \\leq s} W_t(u),$$ where $ W_t(s) = W(s) - \\frac{1}{2}s^2 + t s $.\n$X_i(t)$: $i$th largest excursion of $B_t(\\cdot)$ above zero,\n$\\big( \\pmb{X}(t), t \\ge 0 \\big) $ is a realization of an eternal multiplicative coalescent.\n$W_t(s) = W(s) - \\frac{s^2}{2} + t s$, for $t = 0.5$ $B_t(s) = W_t(s) - \\inf\\limits_{0 \\le u \\le s} W_t(u)$, for $t = 0.5$ $\\Lambda$: homogeneous Poisson point process on $\\mathbb{R}_+^2$, $X_i(t)$: $i$th largest excursion above zero, $Y_i(t)$: nb. of marks below the curve during the $i$th largest excursion. $\\big( (\\pmb{X}(t), \\pmb{Y}(t)), t \\ge 0 \\big) $ is a realization of an eternal augmented multiplicative coalescent.\n$B_t(s) = W_t(s) - \\inf\\limits_{0 \\le u \\le s} W_t(u)$, for $t = 0.5$ Thanks for your attention!

The exact calculation of the expected SFS in panmictic population has been derived in the Markovian coalescent theory for decades, but its generalization to the structured coalescent is hampered by the almost exponential growth of the states space. We propose here a complete algorithmic procedure, from how to build a suitable state space and sort it, to how to take advantage of the sparsity of the rate matrix and to solve numerically the linear system by an iterative method. The simplest case of the symmetrical n-island is then processed to arrive at a ready-to-use demographic parameters inference framework.","tags":["Site Frequency Spectrum","structured population"],"title":"Exact calculation of the expected SFS in structured populations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Josué Corujo","Vlada Limic"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1683590400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1683590400,"objectID":"138223678c4974e54fef9a93bda8ce53","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/09_playful_note/","publishdate":"2023-05-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/09_playful_note/","section":"publication","summary":"Consider a finite inhomogeneous random graph running in continuous time, where each vertex has a mass, and the edge that links any pair of vertices appears with a rate equal to the product of their masses.

In this paper we consider its continuous-time version, where multi-edges and self-loops are also allowed. It is well-known that the sizes of its connected components evolve according to the multiplicative coalescent dynamics. Moreover, with the additional information on the number of surplus edges, the resulting process follows the augmented multiplicative coalescent dynamic, constructed by Bhamidi, Budhiraja and Wang in 2014. The same authors exhibit the scaling limit, which can be specified in terms of the infinite vector of excursions (in particular their lengths, and the areas enclosed by the excursion curves) above past infima of a reflected Brownian motion with linear infinitesimal drift. We use some recent results, using a graph exploration process called the simultaneous breadth-first walk, to study the same scaling limit, called the standard augmented multiplicative coalescent (SAMC). We present a self-contained, simpler and more direct approach than that of any previous construction of the SAMC. Furthermore, we believe that the method described here is convenient for generalizations, one of which would be the study of general non-standard eternal augmented multiplicative coalescents.","tags":["critical Erdös-Renyi random graphs","multiplicative coalescent","augmented multiplicative coalescent"],"title":"The standard augmented multiplicative coalescent revisited","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Josué Corujo"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1679184000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1679184000,"objectID":"8e521861c7c2bacad89537a02b6fe9c3","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/05_spectrum/","publishdate":"2023-03-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/05_spectrum/","section":"publication","summary":"The purpose of this paper is to provide a complete description of the eigenvalues of the generator of a neutral multi-type Moran model, and the applications to the study of the speed of convergence to stationarity. The Moran model we consider is a non-reversible in general, continuous-time Markov chain with unknown stationary distribution. Specifically, we consider $N$ individuals such that each one of them is of one type among $K$ possible allelic types. The individuals interact in two ways, by an independent irreducible mutation process and by a reproduction process, where a pair of individuals is randomly chosen, one of them dies and the other reproduces. Our main result provides explicit expressions for the eigenvalues of the infinitesimal generator matrix of the Moran process, in terms of the eigenvalues of the jump rate matrix. As consequences of this result, we study the convergence in total variation of the process to stationarity. Our results include a lower bound for the mixing time of the Moran process when the mutation process allows a real eigenvalue. Furthermore, we study in detail the spectral decomposition of the neutral multi-allelic Moran model with parent independent mutation scheme, which turns to be the unique mutation scheme that makes the neutral Moran process reversible. Under the parent independent mutation, we also prove the existence of a cutoff phenomenon in the chi-square and the total variation distances when initially all the individuals are of the same type and the number of individuals tends to infinity. Additionally, in the absence of reproduction, we prove that the the total variation distance to stationarity of the parent independent mutation process, when initially all the individuals are of the same type, has a Gaussian profile.","tags":["Moran type particle system","QSD","Cut-off phenomenon"],"title":"On the spectrum and ergodicity of a neutral multi-allelic Moran model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Josué Corujo","David Flores-Peñaloza","Clemens Huemer","Pablo Pérez-Lantero","Carlos Seara"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1678752000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1678752000,"objectID":"cfbaa87ede77a57e36199d6af3897551","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/07_joco/","publishdate":"2023-03-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/07_joco/","section":"publication","summary":"Given $n\u003e0$, let $S\\subset [0,1]^2$ be a set of $n$ points, chosen uniformly at random.

The rate matrix driving the mutation is assumed irreducible and the selection rates are assumed uniformly bounded. The paper is divided into two parts. The first one deals with processes with general selection rates. For this case we are able to prove the propagation of chaos in $L^p$ over the compacts, with speed of convergence of order $1/\\sqrt{N}$. Further on, we consider a specific type of selection that we call additive selection. Essentially, we assume that the selection rate can be decomposed as the sum of three terms, a term depending on the allelic type of the parent (which can be understood as selection at death), another term depending on the allelic type of the descendant (which can be understood as selection at birth) and a third term which is symmetric. Under this setting, our results include a uniform in time bound for the propagation on chaos in Lp of order $1/\\sqrt{N}$, and the proof of the asymptotic normality with zero mean and explicit variance, for the approximation error between the empirical distribution and its limit, when the number of individuals tend towards infinity. Additionally, we explore the interpretation of the Moran model with additive selection as a particle process whose empirical distribution approximates a quasi-stationary distribution, in the same spirit as the Fleming-Viot particle systems. We then address the problem of minimising the asymptotic quadratic error, when the time and the number of particles go to infinity","tags":["Moran type particle system","QSD","Propagation of chaos"],"title":"Uniform in time propagation of chaos for a Moran model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Josué Corujo"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1622505600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1622505600,"objectID":"ed77e14c5ccc4cb80c5dbb2792986cbb","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/04_2019_spa/","publishdate":"2021-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/04_2019_spa/","section":"publication","summary":"We study the Fleming–Viot particle process formed by $N$ interacting continuous-time asymmetric random walks on the cycle graph, with uniform killing.

Most previous works have checked the aging properties of the lifetime of the working units using stochastic comparisons among the systems with age replacement at different times. However, from a practical point of view, it would also be interesting to deduce to which aging classes the lifetime of the system belongs, making use of the aging properties of the lifetime of its working units. The first part of this article deals with this problem. Further along, stochastic orderings are established between the systems with replacement at the same time using several stochastic comparisons among the lifetimes of their working units. In addition, the lifetimes of two systems with age replacement are compared as well. This is performed assuming stochastic orderings between the number of replacement until failure, and the lifetimes of their working units conditioned to be less or equal than the replacement time. Similar comparisons are accomplished considering two systems with age replacement where the replacements occur at a random time. Illustrative examples are presented throughout the paper.","tags":["Age replacement","Stochastic orders"],"title":"Further results on stochastic orderings and aging classes in systems with age replacement","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Josué Corujo","David Flores-Peñaloza","Clemens Huemer","Pablo Pérez-Lantero","Carlos Seara"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1582156800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1582156800,"objectID":"1b20a997e8095886c71090d2b17c4b30","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/0a_matchin_points/","publishdate":"2020-02-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/0a_matchin_points/","section":"publication","summary":"Let $S \\subset [0,1]^2$ be a set of $n$ points, randomly and uniformly selected.

At the same time, there has been an increasing recognition that population structure can generate genetic data similar to those produced under models of population size change. Recently, Mazet et al. (Heredity 116:362–371, 2016) showed that, for any model of population structure, it is always possible to find a panmictic model with a particular function of population size changes, having exactly the same distribution of $T_2$ (the coalescence time for a sample of size two) as that of the structured model. They called this function IICR (Inverse Instantaneous Coalescence Rate) and showed that it does not necessarily correspond to population size changes under non-panmictic models. Besides, most of the methods used to analyse data under models of population structure tend to arbitrarily fix that structure and to minimise or neglect population size changes. Here, we extend the seminal work of Herbots (PhD thesis, University of London, 1994) on the structured coalescent and propose a new framework, the Non-Stationary Structured Coalescent (NSSC) that incorporates demographic events (changes in gene flow and/or deme sizes) to models of nearly any complexity. We show how to compute the IICR under a wide family of stationary and non-stationary models. As an example we address the question of human and Neanderthal evolution and discuss how the NSSC framework allows to interpret genomic data under this new perspective.","tags":["Population genetics","Structured populations","IICR"],"title":"The IICR and the non-stationary structured coalescent: towards demographic inference with arbitrary changes in population structure","type":"publication"}]
