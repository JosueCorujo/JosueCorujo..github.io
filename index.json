In this paper we consider its continuous-time version, where multi-edges and self-loops are also allowed. It is well-known that the sizes of its connected components evolve according to the multiplicative coalescent dynamics. Moreover, with the additional information on the number of surplus edges, the resulting process follows the augmented multiplicative coalescent dynamic, constructed by Bhamidi, Budhiraja and Wang in 2014. The same authors exhibit the scaling limit, which can be specified in terms of the infinite vector of excursions (in particular their lengths, and the areas enclosed by the excursion curves) above past infima of a reflected Brownian motion with linear infinitesimal drift. We use some recent results, using a graph exploration process called the simultaneous breadth-first walk, to study the same scaling limit, called the standard augmented multiplicative coalescent (SAMC). We present a self-contained, simpler and more direct approach than that of any previous construction of the SAMC. Furthermore, we believe that the method described here is convenient for generalizations, one of which would be the study of general non-standard eternal augmented multiplicative coalescents.","tags":["critical Erdös-Renyi random graphs","multiplicative coalescent","augmented multiplicative coalescent"],"title":"The standard augmented multiplicative coalescent revisited","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" PDF Chachachá, my cat Table of Contents Education Preprints Publications in Journals Publications in Conferences PhD Manuscript Conferences and Talks Teaching Skills Computational Languages Education (2018-2021) PhD Mathematics, Université Paris-Dauphine, France (2015-2017) MSc Mathematics, University of Havana, Cuba (2011-2015) BSc Mathematics, University of Havana, Cuba Preprints (2023) Corujo, J. and Limic, V.

The Moran model we consider is a non-reversible in general, continuous-time Markov chain with unknown stationary distribution. Specifically, we consider $N$ individuals such that each one of them is of one type among $K$ possible allelic types. The individuals interact in two ways, by an independent irreducible mutation process and by a reproduction process, where a pair of individuals is randomly chosen, one of them dies and the other reproduces. Our main result provides explicit expressions for the eigenvalues of the infinitesimal generator matrix of the Moran process, in terms of the eigenvalues of the jump rate matrix. As consequences of this result, we study the convergence in total variation of the process to stationarity. Our results include a lower bound for the mixing time of the Moran process when the mutation process allows a real eigenvalue. Furthermore, we study in detail the spectral decomposition of the neutral multi-allelic Moran model with parent independent mutation scheme, which turns to be the unique mutation scheme that makes the neutral Moran process reversible. Under the parent independent mutation, we also prove the existence of a cutoff phenomenon in the chi-square and the total variation distances when initially all the individuals are of the same type and the number of individuals tends to infinity. Additionally, in the absence of reproduction, we prove that the the total variation distance to stationarity of the parent independent mutation process, when initially all the individuals are of the same type, has a Gaussian profile.","tags":["Moran type particle system","QSD","Cut-off phenomenon"],"title":"On the spectrum and ergodicity of a neutral multi-allelic Moran model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Josué Corujo","David Flores-Peñaloza","Clemens Huemer","Pablo Pérez-Lantero","Carlos Seara"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1678752000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1678752000,"objectID":"cfbaa87ede77a57e36199d6af3897551","permalink":"https://JosueCorujo.github.io/publication/07_joco/","publishdate":"2023-03-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/07_joco/","section":"publication","summary":"Given $n\u003e0$, let $S\\subset [0,1]^2$ be a set of $n$ points, chosen uniformly at random.

The rate matrix driving the mutation is assumed irreducible and the selection rates are assumed uniformly bounded. The paper is divided into two parts. The first one deals with processes with general selection rates. For this case we are able to prove the propagation of chaos in $L^p$ over the compacts, with speed of convergence of order $1/\\sqrt{N}$. Further on, we consider a specific type of selection that we call additive selection. Essentially, we assume that the selection rate can be decomposed as the sum of three terms, a term depending on the allelic type of the parent (which can be understood as selection at death), another term depending on the allelic type of the descendant (which can be understood as selection at birth) and a third term which is symmetric. Under this setting, our results include a uniform in time bound for the propagation on chaos in Lp of order $1/\\sqrt{N}$, and the proof of the asymptotic normality with zero mean and explicit variance, for the approximation error between the empirical distribution and its limit, when the number of individuals tend towards infinity. Additionally, we explore the interpretation of the Moran model with additive selection as a particle process whose empirical distribution approximates a quasi-stationary distribution, in the same spirit as the Fleming-Viot particle systems. We then address the problem of minimising the asymptotic quadratic error, when the time and the number of particles go to infinity","tags":["Moran type particle system","QSD","Propagation of chaos"],"title":"Uniform in time propagation of chaos for a Moran model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Josué Corujo"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1622505600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1622505600,"objectID":"ed77e14c5ccc4cb80c5dbb2792986cbb","permalink":"https://JosueCorujo.github.io/publication/04_2019_spa/","publishdate":"2021-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/04_2019_spa/","section":"publication","summary":"We study the Fleming–Viot particle process formed by $N$ interacting continuous-time asymmetric random walks on the cycle graph, with uniform killing.

Most previous works have checked the aging properties of the lifetime of the working units using stochastic comparisons among the systems with age replacement at different times. However, from a practical point of view, it would also be interesting to deduce to which aging classes the lifetime of the system belongs, making use of the aging properties of the lifetime of its working units. The first part of this article deals with this problem. Further along, stochastic orderings are established between the systems with replacement at the same time using several stochastic comparisons among the lifetimes of their working units. In addition, the lifetimes of two systems with age replacement are compared as well. This is performed assuming stochastic orderings between the number of replacement until failure, and the lifetimes of their working units conditioned to be less or equal than the replacement time. Similar comparisons are accomplished considering two systems with age replacement where the replacements occur at a random time. Illustrative examples are presented throughout the paper.","tags":["Age replacement","Stochastic orders"],"title":"Further results on stochastic orderings and aging classes in systems with age replacement","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Josué Corujo","David Flores-Peñaloza","Clemens Huemer","Pablo Pérez-Lantero","Carlos Seara"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1582156800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1582156800,"objectID":"1b20a997e8095886c71090d2b17c4b30","permalink":"https://JosueCorujo.github.io/publication/0a_matchin_points/","publishdate":"2020-02-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/0a_matchin_points/","section":"publication","summary":"Let $S \\subset [0,1]^2$ be a set of $n$ points, randomly and uniformly selected.

At the same time, there has been an increasing recognition that population structure can generate genetic data similar to those produced under models of population size change. Recently, Mazet et al. (Heredity 116:362–371, 2016) showed that, for any model of population structure, it is always possible to find a panmictic model with a particular function of population size changes, having exactly the same distribution of $T_2$ (the coalescence time for a sample of size two) as that of the structured model. They called this function IICR (Inverse Instantaneous Coalescence Rate) and showed that it does not necessarily correspond to population size changes under non-panmictic models. Besides, most of the methods used to analyse data under models of population structure tend to arbitrarily fix that structure and to minimise or neglect population size changes. Here, we extend the seminal work of Herbots (PhD thesis, University of London, 1994) on the structured coalescent and propose a new framework, the Non-Stationary Structured Coalescent (NSSC) that incorporates demographic events (changes in gene flow and/or deme sizes) to models of nearly any complexity. We show how to compute the IICR under a wide family of stationary and non-stationary models. As an example we address the question of human and Neanderthal evolution and discuss how the NSSC framework allows to interpret genomic data under this new perspective.","tags":["Population genetics","Structured populations","IICR"],"title":"The IICR and the non-stationary structured coalescent: towards demographic inference with arbitrary changes in population structure","type":"publication"}]
